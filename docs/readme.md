## float precision

```
nix-repl> 0.300001 # 6 digits after comma
0.300001

nix-repl> 0.3000001 # 7 digits after comma
0.3
```

### C++

```cc
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	double a = 0.1;
    double b = 0.2;
    double result = a + b;
    printf("%.17f", result);
	return 0;
}
```

result:

> 0.30000000000000004

## lazy evaluation vs reactive programming

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575498/lazy-evaluation-and-reactive-programming
  * lazy evaluation is a language facility that allows the existence and manipulation of infinite data
    * infinite in the sense that you can pull off as much as you want and still have some left over.
    * you don't "loop forever"
    * performance gains
    * only compute as much of an answer as you need to do more work, and then keep around a holder (typically called a "thunk") that will let you do more work when you need it
  * reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change
    * express static or dynamic data flows
      * define ("declare") how data flows will be propagated
    * the underlying execution model will automatically propagate changes through the data flow
      * without explicitly having to implement it using callbacks and function pointers
    * most people will call GUI frameworks reactive.
      * in language like C or C++, you typically do reactive programming via function pointers or callbacks, without an explicit notion of lazy evaluation
  * in [functional reactive programming (FRP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming), you declaratively specify reactive data
    * implemented "under the hood" using the laziness of the Haskell language
  * if you look at libraries like [Bacon.js](https://baconjs.github.io/) or [Lazy.js](https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js), it really seems that under the hood their implementation can easily be realised by using the reactive paradigm (eg, with **streams**)
    * stream of events
